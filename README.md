Hello Everyone!

Here's another project from my frontend learning journey that I hope you'll find useful and enjoyable.

It's a daily note-taking application with different colors, also doubling as a todo list to some extent. You can write and save notes in various colors, and with a simple click, you can delete them.

I've developed this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I would be delighted if you find this project engaging and consider giving it a star.
